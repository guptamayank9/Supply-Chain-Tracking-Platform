# Supply-Chain-Tracking-Platform
I'd be happy to provide more detailed information about the Supply Chain Tracking Platform project. Let me create a more comprehensive breakdown for you.

I've created a detailed breakdown of the Supply Chain Tracking Platform project for you. Here are the key highlights:

This blockchain solution would provide end-to-end visibility for tracking products throughout the supply chain with features like:

- Product registration and tokenization with QR/NFC integration
- Real-time tracking with IoT sensor integration
- Role-based access for different stakeholders
- Analytics dashboard for performance metrics
- Consumer-facing authentication interface

The detailed estimate includes:
- A 5-7 month timeline broken down by phase
- Specific resource requirements with roles and responsibilities
- Comprehensive cost breakdown ($270,000-$420,000 for development)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Implementation roadmap from MVP to future expansion
- Sample smart contract structure showing core functionality
